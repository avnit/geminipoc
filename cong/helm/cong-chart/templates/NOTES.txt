NOTES:

1.  **Image Tags**: Several components are configured to use the 'latest' image tag.
    For production deployments, it is strongly recommended to use specific, immutable image tags
    to ensure your deployments are predictable and rollback-able.
    Please update the following in your values.yaml file:
    - kgservice.image.tag
    - jobScheduler.image.tag
    - jobExecutor.image.tag
    - bootstrap.image.tag

2.  **Default Secrets**: This chart is pre-configured with default secrets for several components.
    These are insecure and should be changed for production environments.
    Please update the following in your values.yaml file or via --set flags:
    - vault.rootToken
    - mysql.rootPassword
    - mysql.userPassword

3.  **NGINX Service**: The NGINX service is exposed as a LoadBalancer by default. You can access it
   using the external IP address assigned by your cloud provider.
   You can get the external IP by running:
   `kubectl get svc --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "cong-chart.fullname" . }}-nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'`
